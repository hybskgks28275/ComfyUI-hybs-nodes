# sample.toml — Conditional LoRA rules (English)
# Each [[lora]] entry is evaluated against the *positive* prompt using a Python-style regex.
# If multiple entries match, they are applied in order (top to bottom).
# `name` is a path relative to your `loras/` directory.

# Example 1: phrase “red dress” (case-insensitive), allowing one or more spaces
[[lora]]
trigger = "(?i)red\\s+dress"
name = "characters/wardrobe/red_dress_lora.safetensors"
strength_model = 1.0

# Example 2: either “nurse” or “white coat” (case-insensitive)
[[lora]]
trigger = "(?i)(nurse|white\\s*coat)"
name = "characters/nurse/nurse_v5.safetensors"
strength_model = 0.8
strength_clip  = 0.8

# Example 3: whole word “wizard” (case-insensitive)
[[lora]]
trigger = "(?i)\\bwizard\\b"
name = "styles/fantasy/wizard_style_v2.safetensors"

# Example 4: “short hair” but not “short hair cut” (case-insensitive, negative lookahead)
